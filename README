Package for hierarchically decomposing the Cosmic Web into Voids, Walls and Filaments.
The SpineWeb algorithm is based on the discrete watershed transform
as described in Aragon et a. 2008 (in preparation). 

The pipeline takes as input a density field. This is usually computed with the
DTFE method (Schaap et al. 2007)

The complete package consists of several programs (should be run in this order):

median_filter
  Cleans the density field from hot pixels arising from aliasing due
  to the samplin scheme. It substututes the value at each pixel by the
  median of its 27 neighbourhood if the pixel's value is higher than a
  given number of times the median.

  Median filtering should be used in order to minimize spurious local 
  maximum spreading with the gaussian filtering (see below).
  
fft_smooth
  Smooths the density field with a Gaussian kernel. This should be done
  with a small kernel in order to smooth out small-scale fluctuations.
  2-3 pixels is ok in general.

watershed_3d
  This is the core program of the procedure. It computes the watershed
  transform using a combination of maximum gradient and queues algorithms.
  The main segmentation is done by first identifying individual voids
  by follogins the maximum gradient paths from the local minimum. 
  Subsequently the watershed transform is computed by sorting the
  void boundaries in density and the aplying a local version of the
  queues algorithm. This method is effective for large grids since the
  sorting is restricted to a small subsample of the total grid.

  Subsequently for each pixel in the watershed a label is assigned as
  function of its number of adjacent voids (inside a 27 neigbourhood).
  We assign morpholgies by the following prescription:

   # Adjacent    |    Morphology
   -------------------------------------------------------
    1           ->    Void
    2           ->    Not defined (boundary of thick spine?)
    3           ->    Wall 
    4 or more   ->    Spine (filaments and clusters)

Compute wall catalogues
  There is a routine to copmute wall catalogues, the catalogues are stored as
  data cubes with -1 for pixels outside walls and pixels in walls labeled with
  their wall id

compute_distances
  Compute the distance transform. This is not part of the SpineWeb pipeline
  but it is useful for constructing scale-space and to compute several
  properties of the cosmic Web.

There are some utilities in the double_to_float/ folder. I use double_to_float
for reading more decent-size density fields.
